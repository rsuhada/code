X-ray analysis pipeline.
------------------------

The code serves as an example of bash/python analysis pipeline with
fully automated as well as interactive parts (via config scripts).

The pipeline is under development and documentation is not available,
because the software is not intended to be public yet, but rather as a
sample/demonstration example.
