Confirmed that the bottleneck is at the moment the moment the
extract_generic routine (about 5s for 900x900)

* TODO actually run fitter on 2e5 beta to confirm that it works
* TODO actually run fitter on 2e3 beta to confirm that it works
* TODO actually run fitter on 2e3 beta x psf to confirm that it works
* TODO need to look at speedup possibility via matrix ops
* TODO need to thik about image size handling (can lead to speed up,
  including if I can assume exact center of cluster)
