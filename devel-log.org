** DONE [#A] actually run fitter on 2e5 beta to confirm that it works
  CLOSED: [2012-09-17 Mon 19:30]

Sucessful: [[result_lmfitter_beta.png]]

parameter: true | fit
rcore 10.0 10.6277787014 +/- 0.115453837186
beta 0.666666666667 0.692480574855 +/- 0.00708285330472

fitting took roughly:  740.88284  s on (900, 900) image


** DONE [#A] actually run fitter on 2e3 beta x psf to confirm that it works
   CLOSED: [2012-09-18 Tue 08:25]

   Sucessful: [[result_lmfitter_beta_psf.png]]

   fitting took:  979.982657  s

   parameter: true | fit
   rcore 10.0 10.4510325964 +/- 0.422839552458
   beta 0.666666666667 0.676426452245 +/- 0.0183221247242


** TODO [#C] actually run fitter on 2e3 beta to confirm that it works

** TODO [#C] need to look at speedup possibility via matrix ops

** TODO [#B] need to thik about image size handling (can lead to speed up,
   including if I can assume exact center of cluster)


** TODO [#B] check extractor speedup possibilities - the obvoius one with passing

** TODO [#A] add vikhlini model

** TODO [#A] add vikhlini model fitter

** TODO [#A] start real data integration

Confirmed that the bottleneck is at the moment the moment the
extract_generic routine (about 5s for 900x900)

run some further test, fitter seems to work but rather slowly

Problem occurred: what to do if observation is split into 2 obsids
(i.e. not one obsid into more eventlists)

Current solution:

ln -s 0674491401 SPT-CL-J2018-6259a
ln -s 0674491501 SPT-CL-J2018-6259a

** speeding up

- refactored to pass distmatrix to the extractor
- moving code to use bincount for extraction
